Hello, I'll add a more comprehensive README.md file soon. For now, this is just a placeholder.

But TL;DR: This is will be an API similar to Mobalytics or op.gg, but for Dragon's Dogma Online where you can make and share characters/vocations builds. It's a work in progress.
This repo is only the API side of things, I'll do another one for the frontend once I have some basic functionality working here.
